Users can create categories to describe image types they would like to see more of. Sequential images are generated and users can decide if those images match a chosen categories parameters.The data sets and category assignments are then processed via machine learning. Users can then check the results of their training.*At least 30 yes and 30 no votes are needed per category to get meaningful results.*
